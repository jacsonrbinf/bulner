# BULNER; BUg Localization with word embeddings and NEtwork Regularization

Bug localization (BL) from the bug report is the strategic activity of the software maintaining process. Because BL is a costly and tedious activity, BL techniques information retrieval-based and machine learning-based could aid software engineers. We propose a method for BUg Localization with word embeddings and Network Regularization (BULNER).

## Dataset

We obtained data (source code and code metrics) from three open source projects: 

1. AspectJ: https://github.com/eclipse/org.aspectj


2. Birt: https://github.com/eclipse/birt


3. Tomcat: https://github.com/apache/tomcat

Also, we used Understand tool to calculate different code metrics (object-oriented, volume and complexity metrics). The script to extract code metrics is available on the following repository: https://github.com/fr3d3rico/bug-metrics-research.

We extracted bug report data associated with each project from the Bugzilla repository provided by Ye et al. 2014.
